# ASSIGNMENT 5: Data Structures and Strings in Python


# Task 1: Dictionary Operations
    *   Initializes a dictionary `stud_dict`.
    *   Uses `input()` to get a student's name.
    *   Uses `get()` for safe dictionary lookup.
    *   Includes basic `try-except` for `KeyError` (note: the `except` block's dictionary access could also raise a `KeyError` if the key is truly not present and was not caught by `get()`).

# Task 2: List Operations
    *   Uses `input()` for `start` and `end` values.
    *   Generates a list using {Link: list comprehension https://www.learndatasci.com/solutions/python-list-comprehension/}.
    *   Performs list slicing `list[0:5]`.
    *   Uses the `sort(reverse=True)` method for in-place descending sort.
    *   Prints the original and manipulated lists.

# Learnings

* Active learning:  Applied concepts like dictionaries, lists, slicing, and sorting directly through coding.
* Hands-on experience: Writing and running the code reinforces understanding and familiarizes me with Python syntax.
* Problem-solving: Tasks challenged me to think through logic and identify solutions, building crucial debugging skills.
