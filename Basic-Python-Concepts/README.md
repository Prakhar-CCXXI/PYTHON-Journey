**Python Program for Basic Math Operations and Personalized Greeting**

This Python program consists of two main tasks:

1. It takes two numbers as input from the user and performs basic mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—then displays the results.

2. It prompts the user to enter their first and last name, combines them into a full name, and prints a personalized greeting message.

The program demonstrates fundamental Python concepts such as user input, arithmetic operations, string concatenation, and formatted output.
